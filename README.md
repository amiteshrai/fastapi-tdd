# Test-Driven Development with FastAPI and Docker

Along with Python and FastAPI, we'll use Docker to quickly set up our local development environment and simplify deployment. Tortoise ORM, an async ORM (Object Relational Mapper), will be used to interact with a Postgres database. We'll use pytest instead of unittest for writing unit and integration tests to test the API. Finally, we'll store the code on a GitHub repository and utilize GitHub Actions to run tests before deploying to Heroku.
